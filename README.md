# Sixth-Sense


Sixth Sense is an ambien baby monitor. 

Its goal is to explore new ways in which technology can help us interface with others in a non verbal way. 

The device acts as baby monitor lamp, it is constantly "listening" to its environment and when it detects specific patterns of change in sound intensity it changes light color to indicate that a baby is crying. 

This repository contains all the files needed to build your own Sixth Sense device, this version does not separate the detection components from the light source, doing so would be helpful for creating a network of sixth sense devices around a home that are all connected to the detection module (laying besides the baby) so that the baby can seamlessly stay communicated with his parents in any room of the house. I encourage people to explore ways in which this idea could be expanded through different setting, connection schemes and devices. 

Required Hardware for Mark I:
  -Arduino Nano - Arduino Uno
  -RGB LED
  -Cables / Jumpers
